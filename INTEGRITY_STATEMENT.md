# ⚖️ Statement of Integrity & Tool Disclosure

| Metadata | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Document ID** | SIF-GOV-001 |
| **Author** | Kathryn E. Wilson |
| **Status** | Public Disclosure |
| **Effective Date** | January 2026 |

## 1. Purpose
The **Shadow Identity Framework (SIF)** is a project rooted in the principles of transparency and open-source collaboration. This statement outlines the methodology used to develop the framework’s documentation, standards, and GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) structures, specifically regarding the use of Generative AI.

## 2. Human-Centric Architecture
The **Architecture, Logic, and Strategic Direction** of the SIF are the original work of Kathryn E. Wilson. 
* The "Hub-and-Spoke" model, the specific "Vault vs. Mask" identity decoupling strategy, and the 1,000-year M-DISC archival workflow were conceived based on the author's professional experience and academic research at Purdue University Global.

## 3. Disclosure of AI as a Productivity Tool
In alignment with 2026 industry standards for technical documentation and software development, this project utilizes **Large Language Models (LLMs)** as secondary productivity tools. 



### 3.1 Authorized Uses of AI in SIF:
* **Structural Scaffolding:** Generating Markdown templates and GRC-compliant headers.
* **Drafting & Refinement:** Translating technical requirements into polished, scannable documentation.
* **Cross-Referencing:** Verifying that framework standards align with established industry norms (e.g., NIST, FIDO2, and GDPR principles).
* **Formatting:** Ensuring consistent LaTeX rendering for complex variables and proper Markdown hierarchy.

### 3.2 Prohibited Uses (Zero-Knowledge Guardrails):
* **No Private Data:** At no point has any PII (Personally Identifiable Information), private key, or actual account credential been shared with or processed by a cloud-based AI.
* **No Unverified Logic:** No technical procedure or migration guide is published without "Human-in-the-loop" physical verification.

## 4. Technical Verification Protocol
Every standard and migration guide within this repository (e.g., `SIF-STD-002: MFA Standards`) has been **physically tested and verified** by the author on live hardware. The AI serves as the "Technical Writer," while the author serves as the "Lead Engineer" and "Auditor."

## 5. Professional Rationale
The rejection of modern productivity tools like Generative AI in the development of GRC frameworks is viewed by this project as a step backward in operational efficiency. Just as the industry evolved to use IDEs, spell-checkers, and search engines, the SIF embraces AI to accelerate the deployment of security solutions for the public good.

> "Authenticity in open-source is defined by the utility of the logic and the transparency of the process, not by the manual labor of the prose."
