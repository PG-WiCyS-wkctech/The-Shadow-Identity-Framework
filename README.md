> **A professional-grade system for personal data sovereignty.** > Decouple your digital identity from your communication, mask your metadata, and transition from high-cost "Cloud Renting" to permanent physical ownership.

## 🚀 The Mission: From Chaos to Sovereignty

Most digital users suffer from **"Email Bloat"** and **"Identity Leakage."** We give out our primary login email to every bank, school, and store, creating a massive security risk and mounting monthly cloud storage fees.

The **Shadow Identity Framework** solves this through three core pillars:
1.  **Identity Cloaking:** Using "Vault" addresses for logins and "Mask" addresses for communications.
2.  **The Storage Diet:** A systematic "Burn and Purge" workflow to move data from expensive clouds to **1,000-year M-DISC archives**.
3.  **Cryptographic Assurance:** Enforcing hardware MFA (YubiKeys) and S/MIME encryption as non-negotiable standards.

## 📂 Repository Architecture

This repository is organized as a **GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)** environment.

| Directory | Content | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[📜 /standards](./standards)** | The "Laws" | Non-negotiable rules for Passwords, MFA, and Encryption. |
| **[📂 /documentation](./documentation)** | The "Manuals" | Deep-dive blueprints for iCloud, Google, and Outlook. |
| **[🎓 /curriculum](./curriculum)** | The "Roadmap" | Level 1-4 learning paths from Beginner to Archivist. |
| **[🛠️ /hardware](./hardware)** | The "Tools" | Specs for M-DISC burners, Encrypted SSDs, and YubiKeys. |
| **[📊 /templates](./templates)** | The "Blueprints" | Master Sync Matrix and Data Inventory spreadsheets. |
| **[✅ /checklists](./checklists)** | The "Operations" | Step-by-step setup guides for active configuration. |

## 🛠️ Getting Started (The Workflow)

To implement SIF for your digital life, follow this sequence:

1.  **Audit (Templates):** Download the [Master Sync Matrix](./templates) and map your existing 7+ accounts.
2.  **Learn (Curriculum):** Move through [Level 1 and 2](./curriculum) to understand the Hub-and-Spoke model.
3.  **Hardening (Standards):** Apply the [Identity & Encryption Standards](./standards) (MFA, Passwords).
4.  **Execution (Checklists):** Follow the [iCloud or Gmail Checklists](./checklists) to "Flip" your identity.
5.  **Archival (Hardware):** Execute your first "Burn and Purge" to [M-DISC or SSD](./hardware).

## 🏛️ GRC Compliance Summary

This framework operates under a strict compliance model:

* **Governance:** Every account must have a defined **Vault** (Secret) and **Mask** (Public) identity.
* **Risk:** SMS recovery is prohibited. Hardware-backed 2FA is the minimum standard for the "Hub."
* **Compliance:** Annual audits ensure cloud storage remains below the "Billing Wall" (Free Tier) and physical backups are verified.

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy
* **Zero-Knowledge:** This repository contains *structures*, not *data*. Never commit your populated spreadsheets or private keys.
* **Local-First:** We prioritize local encrypted storage over cloud-syncing whenever possible.
