🛡️ The Shadow Identity Framework (SIF)
Enterprise-Grade Email Security and Data Sovereignty for the Modern Individual.

The Shadow Identity Framework is an open-source methodology designed to decouple your Login Identity from your Public Persona. In a world of constant data breaches and rising cloud costs, SIF provides a blueprint for "Cloaked Logins" and long-term physical data retention.

📖 The Core Philosophy: "Identity ≠ Communication"
Most people use their primary email address as their username for every website. If that email is leaked, your entire digital life is at risk. SIF fixes this using the Shadow Identity model:

The Vault (Shadow Identity): A secret, unguessable email address used only for account login. It is never used to send mail and is never shared with humans.

The Mask (Public Alias): The address you give to banks, schools, and friends. It acts as a "firewall" for your Vault.

The Purge (Data Sovereignty): A systematic workflow to move high-volume data (photos/videos) from "rented" cloud space to "owned" physical media.

🚀 Key Features
Zero-Cost Scaling: Learn how to stay within the free tiers of iCloud and Gmail forever.

Credential Cloaking: Techniques to ensure your secret login address is never leaked in email headers.

Unified Interface: A strategy for managing 5+ email addresses in one app without data duplication.

1,000-Year Backups: Guides on using M-DISC and encrypted SSD technology for permanent archives.

🛠️ Getting Started
1. The Audit
Map out your current "Digital Footprint." Identify which accounts are essential and which are legacy (like old AOL/Yahoo accounts) that increase your attack surface.

2. Establish the "Hub"
Choose your primary secure interface (e.g., iCloud). Set up the Master Sync Matrix to track your aliases, recovery loops, and storage status.

Note: Use the Template Spreadsheet provided in this repo.

3. The "Burn and Purge"
Download your historical data to physical media. Once verified, delete the cloud versions to reset your storage billing to $0.

🛡️ GRC Compliance for the Family
This project applies the pillars of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) to personal data:

Governance: You own the rules of your data flow.

Risk: Minimizing the attack surface via cloaked logins.

Compliance: Ensuring your digital legacy is stored on immutable media (M-DISC).
