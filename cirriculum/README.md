# 🎓 Shadow Identity Framework: The Curriculum

Welcome to the learning center of the **Shadow Identity Framework (SIF)**. This curriculum is designed to transform "Email Chaos" into a high-security, low-cost "Shadow Identity" system. 

This roadmap is divided into four stages, taking you from a basic user to a GRC-literate digital archivist.

## 🟢 Level 1: The Guardian (Beginners & Kids)
**Focus:** Mindset shift and "Identity Literacy."

### 1.1 The "Two Doors" Concept
* **The Lesson:** Your email is not just a mailbox; it is the key to your digital house.
* **The Goal:** Understand that your "Login Address" should never be the same as the "Public Address" you give to friends.
* **Lab:** Draw a map of your current email "doors" (AOL, Gmail, Purdue, etc.) and identify which ones are currently "unlocked" (publicly known).

### 1.2 The "Cloud Hotel" Metaphor
* **The Lesson:** Cloud storage is a rented room. If the rent goes up or the hotel closes, you lose your stuff.
* **The Goal:** Understand the difference between "Renting" (iCloud/Google One) and "Owning" (Physical SSD).

## 🟡 Level 2: The Architect (Intermediate)
**Focus:** Technical consolidation and storage hygiene.

### 2.1 The Hub-and-Spoke Design
* **The Lesson:** Managing 7 emails in 7 apps is high-risk. 
* **The Goal:** Route all "Spokes" (Outlook, Gmail, University) into one "Hub" (iCloud) without deleting the original accounts.

### 2.2 The Master Sync Matrix
* **The Lesson:** If you don't document it, you'll lose access.
* **The Goal:** Populate the `Master_Sync_Matrix.csv` with recovery emails, 2FA methods, and account purposes.
* **Lab:** Export all contacts from Gmail/Outlook, de-duplicate them, and import them into the iCloud Hub as the "Single Source of Truth."
