## 📖 Overview
This directory serves as the **Single Source of Truth** for the ethical, legal, and professional standards used to develop the Shadow Identity Framework. 

As a project rooted in **Digital Sovereignty**, we believe that transparency is the ultimate security control. This hub contains the audit trails, methodology statements, and verification logs required to prove the authenticity and technical validity of our work.

## 🛡️ The "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL) Protocol
The Shadow Identity Framework rejects "Prompt & Dump" automation. Every standard and policy in this repository follows the **SIF-HITL Protocol**, which ensures that the human architect remains the sole source of strategic logic.



1.  **Requirement Definition:** The Project Lead (Kathryn Wilson) defines the strategic threat model (e.g., "Securing a Spoke identity against SIM-swapping").
2.  **Inquiry & Scaffolding:** AI tools are used to retrieve industry standards (NIST/FIDO2) and scaffold GRC-compliant formatting.
3.  **Critical Refinement:** The Project Lead rewrites, paraphrases, and infuses the text with the SIF's unique architectural voice and unique requirements.
4.  **Physical Audit:** No standard is finalized until the Project Lead physically verifies the technical migration on hardware (e.g., YubiKey, M-DISC, or Linux-hardened environments).

## ⚖️ A Note on Professional Integrity
The use of modern productivity tools (LLMs) in this project is treated with the same rigor as the use of a calculator in engineering or a search engine in law. 

We follow the **APA 7th Edition** guidelines for AI disclosure. We maintain that **Sovereignty** begins with owning your tools, not fearing them. If a control in this framework passes a technical audit, it is a valid security measure regardless of the drafting software used. 

Any claim of plagiarism is mathematically and logically refuted by the presence of our **Verification Ledger** and **Disclosure Statements**, which provide positive assurance of human-led authorship and physical validation.
