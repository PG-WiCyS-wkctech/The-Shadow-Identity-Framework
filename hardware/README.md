# 🛠️ Hardware: The Physical Foundation of Data Sovereignty

> **Folder Status:** Active  
> **Primary Goal:** Eliminate cloud storage fees and establish 1,000-year data durability.

In the **Shadow Identity Framework**, hardware is our "Fail-Safe." If a cloud provider freezes your account or raises prices, your hardware ensures you retain 100% of your digital life. We categorize hardware into **Cold Storage** (Permanent), **Warm Storage** (Active Backup), and **Access Keys** (Identity).

## 🏛️ 1. Cold Storage: The 1,000-Year Archive (M-DISC)
Traditional DVDs and hard drives fail after 5–10 years due to "disc rot" or mechanical failure. **M-DISC** technology uses a rock-like data layer that is physically engraved, making it immune to light, heat, and humidity.

### Recommended Burners (2026 Standard)
| Device | Format | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ASUS BW-16D1HT** | Internal/External | The "Gold Standard" for M-DISC. Best when paired with an OWC Mercury Pro enclosure. |
| **LG WH16NS60** | Internal | Supports 4K UHD and BD-XL (100GB) M-DISC burning. |
| **Pioneer BDR-XS07UHD** | Portable | Best for laptop users; slim form factor with M-DISC support. |

### Recommended Media
* **Verbatim M-DISC BD-R XL (100GB):** Best value-per-GB for large photo/video libraries.
* **Verbatim M-DISC BD-R (25GB):** Ideal for "Annual Document Snapshots" (Taxes, Legal, Medical).

## ⚡ 2. Warm Storage: Encrypted SSDs (Active Backup)
For data you need to access frequently (the last 2 years of photos), we use high-speed SSDs with **AES 256-bit Hardware Encryption**.

### Top Picks for 2026
1.  **Samsung T7 Shield:** Best overall. Rugged (IP65), fast (1,050MB/s), and features hardware-level password protection.
2.  **Crucial X9 Pro:** Best "Budget-to-Performance" ratio. Tiny footprint, 10Gbps speeds, and very reliable for daily syncs.
3.  **Samsung T7 Touch:** Best for shared family computers; uses a **fingerprint scanner** for instant, secure access.

> ⚠️ **Warning on SSDs:** SSDs store data using electrical charges. If left unpowered in a drawer for more than 2 years, they can lose data ("Leakage"). **Do not use SSDs as your only long-term archive.** Use M-DISC for anything you want to keep for 10+ years.

## 🔑 3. Access Keys: Hardware 2FA
To protect your "Shadow Identity," you must move away from SMS codes (which can be intercepted via SIM-swapping) to physical security keys.

* **YubiKey 5C NFC:** The industry standard. Fits USB-C and works via NFC with iPhones/Androids.
* **Google Titan Security Key:** A cost-effective alternative for protecting Gmail and iCloud accounts.

## 📋 The "Storage Diet" Procurement List
If you are starting from zero, this is your shopping list to exit the "Cloud Rent" cycle:

1.  **The Burner:** ASUS BW-16D1HT + OWC Mercury Pro Enclosure (~$160)
2.  **The Media:** 5-Pack of 100GB M-DISC BD-R XL (~$80)
3.  **The Daily Drive:** 2TB Samsung T7 Shield (~$180)
4.  **The Key:** 2x YubiKey 5C (One for your keychain, one for the fireproof safe).

## 🔄 Maintenance & Rotation Policy (GRC-HW-01)
To ensure compliance with the Shadow Identity Framework, follow this rotation:

* **Quarterly (The SSD Sync):** Plug in your SSD, sync all new photos/videos from the Hub (iCloud/Gmail), and verify files. This "refreshes" the electrical charge in the cells.
* **Annually (The M-DISC Burn):** Every January, burn the previous year's "Finalized" data to an M-DISC.
* **Geographic Separation:** Store your M-DISCs in a different physical location (e.g., a relative's house or a safety deposit box) to protect against fire/theft.
