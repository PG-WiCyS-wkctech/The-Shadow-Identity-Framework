# 🏛️ Digital Inheritance Plan

> **Document ID:** GRC-REC-002  
> **Classification:** RESTRICTED / LEGAL  
> **Purpose:** To provide a designated "Digital Executor" with the tools and authority to manage or recover the SIF archive.

This document serves as the operational guide for my heirs or legal representatives. Because this framework utilizes **Biometric Passkeys** and **Shadow Identities**, traditional password recovery methods will not work. Access depends entirely on the physical assets stored in the **Fireproof Safe**.

---

## 👤 1. The Digital Executor
The following individual(s) are designated as the primary "Keyholders" for this framework:

* **Primary Executor:** [Name]
* **Secondary Executor:** [Name]

---

## 📍 2. Accessing the Gateway
To begin the inheritance process, the Executor must first gain physical access to the **SIF Storage Vault (Fireproof Safe)** located at:
> **Location:** [Insert Location - e.g., Master Bedroom Closet / Safety Deposit Box]

### Physical Inventory Required for Access:
1.  **The Backup YubiKey:** Labeled `[BACKUP-01]`. This key bypasses the need for my FaceID/Fingerprint.
2.  **The Cold Passphrase:** A printed envelope containing the "Diceware" Master Password.
3.  **The Master Ledger:** The physical printout of the `Master_Sync_Matrix`.

## 🗝️ 3. Platform-Specific Legacy Access
We utilize native "Legacy" protocols to ensure legal and seamless transition of data.

| Platform | Protocol | Executor Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Apple (iCloud)** | **Legacy Contact** | Use the "Access Key" (printed in safe) via `digital-legacy.apple.com`. |
| **Google (Vault)** | **Inactive Account Manager**| Google will automatically contact [Name] after [X] months of inactivity. |
| **Password Manager** | **Emergency Access** | Use the "Emergency Access" feature in [Bitwarden/Dashlane] to request vault transfer. |

## 📂 4. The Recovery Sequence

### Step 1: Access the Hub (iCloud/Gmail)
Do not attempt to use the primary smartphone (it may be locked/disabled). Instead:
1.  Use a trusted laptop.
2.  Log in using the **Vault Address** from the Master Ledger.
3.  When prompted for MFA, insert the **Backup YubiKey** from the safe.

### Step 2: Decrypt the Master Archive
1.  Locate the **Encrypted SSD** in the safe.
2.  Input the password found on the **"Cold Record"** sheet.
3.  This drive contains the latest backup of all family photos, tax records, and legal documents.

### Step 3: Manage the "Shadow" Subscriptions
1.  Use the `Master_Sync_Matrix` to identify all paid services.
2.  Prioritize keeping the "Hub" (iCloud/Google) active until all data is verified on **M-DISC**.
3.  Systematically close the "Spoke" accounts (Shopping, Social Media).

## 💿 5. The Permanent Heritage (M-DISC)
The **M-DISC Archive** is the final "Gift" of this framework.
* These discs do not require passwords or cloud access.
* They can be read by any standard Blu-ray drive (one is provided in the **Hardware Kit**).
* **Instruction:** These discs contain the "Finalized" family history. They should be kept in a cool, dry place and passed down to future generations.

## ⚖️ 6. Legal Authorization
*Note to Legal Representatives: The assets described in this framework are digital properties. This document, combined with my Last Will and Testament, provides the "Digital Executor" with the authority to bypass technical security measures using the provided physical authenticators.*
