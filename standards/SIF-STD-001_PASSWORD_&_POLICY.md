# 📑 SIF-STD-001: Password & Credential Standard

| Metadata | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Standard ID** | SIF-STD-001 |
| **Status** | 🔴 Mandatory |
| **Version** | 1.0 (2026) |
| **Classification** | Restricted |

## 1. Objective
To eliminate the risk of "Credential Stuffing," "Brute Force," and "Dictionary Attacks" by removing human predictability from the authentication process. 

## 2. The Core Law: Machine Generation
Under the SIF, **no human-memorized passwords** are permitted for individual services or "Spoke" accounts. 
* All passwords must be generated by a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG).
* The only credential a user is permitted to memorize is the **Master Passphrase** to their Zero-Knowledge Vault.

## 3. Technical Complexity Requirements

Every password generated for a service must meet the following minimum criteria:

| Metric | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Minimum Length** | 20 Characters |
| **Character Set** | Alphanumeric + Special Characters (`@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, etc.) |
| **Entropy** | High (No words, names, or dates) |
| **Uniqueness** | 100% (Zero reuse across different services) |

## 4. The Master Passphrase (The Exception)

The Master Passphrase is the "Key to the Kingdom." Because it is the only credential you must remember, it follows the **Diceware Standard** to balance security with memorability.

* **Method:** 5 to 7 random words chosen via dice rolls or a CSPRNG.
* **Format:** Words separated by hyphens or spaces (e.g., `correct-horse-battery-staple-shelf`).
* **Storage:** **Never** store the Master Passphrase in a digital cloud. It must be written on a physical "Cold Record" and stored in the **Fireproof Safe**.

---

## 5. Management & Governance

### 5.1 Zero-Knowledge Management
All credentials must be stored in a **Zero-Knowledge Password Manager** (e.g., Bitwarden, 1Password, or a local KeePassXC database). 
* The manager itself must be secured by the Master Passphrase AND a **Hardware Security Key (SIF-STD-002)**.

### 5.2 Browser Autofill Prohibition
To prevent "Ad-tracker" leakage and unauthorized access:
* Native browser password saving (Chrome/Edge/Safari) is **Prohibited** for "Vault" or "Hub" accounts.
* All autofill actions must be triggered through the authorized, encrypted Manager extension.

### 5.3 Credential Rotation
* **Reactive Rotation:** Passwords must be changed immediately if a "Mask" email is identified in a third-party data breach.
* **Proactive Rotation:** Not required for high-entropy (20+ char) strings unless the service provider's encryption standards are compromised.

## 6. Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Is every password in the `Master_Sync_Matrix` at least 20 characters?
- [ ] Are there zero instances of password reuse?
- [ ] Is the Master Passphrase stored physically in the safe?
- [ ] Have all "Legacy" (human-readable) passwords been rotated out?

**Next Step:** Ensure your Master Passphrase meets these requirements before moving to **[SIF-STD-002: MFA Standards](./SIF-STD-002_MFA_STANDARDS.md)**.
